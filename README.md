## Requirements:
* **Python 3.x**
* **tkinter library**:
    * **How to install**:  

        - **macOS:** Use homebrew to install tkinter:
        ```brew install python-tk``` 
        - **Ubuntu/Debian:** Use apt-get to install tkinter:
        ```sudo apt-get install python3-tk```
        - **Fedora:** Use dnf to install tkinter:
        ```sudo dnf install python3-tkinter```
        - **Windows:** Ensure that the "tcl/tk and IDLE" option is checked during Python installation. If it's already installed, you might need to reinstall Python and ensure this option is selected.     
    

    * **Verify Installation:** After installing, you can verify the installation by running the following commands in a Python interactive shell: 
        ```
        import tkinter 
        tkinter._test()
        ```
        This should open a small test window if tkinter is installed correctly
